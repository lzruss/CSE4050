			Music can be as powerful a motivator as motivational quotes. Each morning when you wake up, play a few pump up songs before you start your day to get you going. 
			You can listen to playlists with motivational songs on Spotify to help you get going.
			By getting your mind in the right mindset, you can inch closer to motivating yourself.
			When I want to get in the zone, I listen to “Time” by Hans Zimmer, which has no lyrics but has an intensity which helps me focus.
			If I’m feeling like I’m in a rut, motivational songs like “You’re a Superstar” by Love Inc. picks me up.
